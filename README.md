# IcoGenerator
Create an ICO file out of multiple PNG files, each PNG for a different resolution. The resolution of the PNG images is kept unchanged, they are not resized in order to keep maximum quality. Having one PNG per resolution gives you the ability to adapt the visualization of your icon for each resolution individually.
